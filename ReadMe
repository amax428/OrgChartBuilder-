- Technical Choices:
* backend
No special choices I choosed rather than the requirements. Just used FastAPI and Sqlite3.

* frontend
Used axios for better api handling.
Besides it,
** version1
React-dnd has a powerful functionality with DnD including Drag a card and drop it on another card, but it does not have built-in feature for connectors between nodes.
** version2
Reactflow has a beautiful UI including connectors between nodes and easy edge connection but it does not have DnD feature on node itself.
